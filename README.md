# -Low-Cost-2D-Position-Sensitive-Detector-for-Muography
This project presents a compact, low-cost, two-dimensional position-sensitive detector built from a 5Ã—5 array of CsI scintillators read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), inspired by outreach/education efforts such as the CERN Beamline for Schools competition, which shaped our experimental approach and validation plan.
